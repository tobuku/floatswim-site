          These checklists offer starting points for common settings where infants and children encounter water: the bath, the home or backyard, and
          natural water like lakes and the ocean.

      <!-- LAYERS OF PROTECTION -->
      <section>
        <h2>Layers of Protection</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          No single measure—fencing, supervision, or lessons—is enough on its own. Drowning prevention works best when multiple layers are in place at
          the same time.
        </p>

        <div class="two-col">
          <div>
            <ul class="tight">
              <li><strong>Barriers:</strong> Fences, gates, door locks, and alarms that separate children from water.</li>
              <li><strong>Supervision:</strong> A dedicated adult “water watcher” with no distractions.</li>
              <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Age-appropriate swim lessons and water survival skills.</li>
              <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Life jackets, rescue equipment, and phones nearby.</li>
              <li><strong>Education:</strong> Teaching kids water rules early and repeating them often.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="note-box">
            A child who “knows how to swim” can still be at risk. Fatigue, panic, medical events, and unexpected conditions can overwhelm even confident
            swimmers. Layers of protection stack the odds in your favor.

        <h2>Emergency Readiness</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          The goal is always prevention. But if something does happen, being prepared to respond quickly and calmly can make a significant difference in
          outcomes.
        </p>

            <div class="pill">Step 1</div>
            <h3>Recognize the emergency</h3>
            <p>
              Drowning is often silent—no splashing, no yelling. If a child is missing, always check water first. Trust your instincts if something feels
              wrong around a pool or bath.

            <div class="pill">Step 2</div>
            <h3>Call for help</h3>
            <p>
              In a suspected drowning or near-drowning, call your local emergency number (such as 911 in the U.S.) immediately. If others are present,
              assign someone specifically to make the call.

              training through the Red Cross, hospitals, or local programs.
