        <h2>What FloatSwim Is</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          FloatSwim is a developing online hub, not a crisis line or emergency service. It's a place to understand drowning risk, learn preventive steps,
          and see how communities can respond with compassion and action.
        </p>

        <div class="two-col">
          <div>
            <ul class="tight">
              <li>A central place to learn about drowning and near-drowning patterns.</li>
              <li>A gentle on-ramp to infant and early-childhood water safety practices.</li>
              <li>A future directory of free and low-cost swim lessons and programs.</li>
              <li>A developing dashboard to visualize patterns without exposing private details.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="note-box">
            FloatSwim cannot provide medical advice, emergency intervention, or legal guidance. In any suspected drowning or near-drowning emergency,
            call your local emergency number immediately (for example, 911 in the United States).

      <!-- GUIDING PRINCIPLES -->
      <section>
        <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Because this project deals with real families, children, and loss, FloatSwim is anchored by a set of non-negotiable principles that guide how
          information is gathered, shown, and discussed.
        </p>

        <div class="grid-3">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="pill">1. Respect</div>
            <h3>Human dignity first</h3>
            <p>
              Incidents and stories will never be treated as content for shock or clicks. The focus is on learning, honoring, and preventing similar
              tragedies—not reliving trauma.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="pill">2. Prevention</div>
            <h3>Actionable, practical steps</h3>
            <p>
              Wherever possible, FloatSwim emphasizes specific, realistic steps parents, caregivers, and communities can take—not just statistics or
              abstract advice.
            </p>

            <div class="pill">3. Clarity</div>
            <h3>Plain language, calm tone</h3>
            <p>
              The topic is serious enough. The site aims for clear, calm, and compassionate language, avoiding fear-mongering while still telling the
              truth about risk.
            </p>

              When incidents are referenced, the emphasis will be on anonymized patterns, age brackets, and settings—not names, addresses, or identifying
              specifics, especially for minors.

              <li><strong>Phase 3 – Deeper tools:</strong> Add alerts, more detailed trends, and organizing tools for community campaigns and advocacy.</li>
