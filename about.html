      <section>
        <h2>What FloatSwim Is</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          FloatSwim is a developing online hub, not a crisis line or emergency service. It’s a place to understand drowning risk, learn preventive steps,
          and see how communities can respond with compassion and action.
        </p>

        <div class="two-col">
          <div>
            <ul class="tight">
              <li>A central place to learn about drowning and near-drowning patterns.</li>
              <li>A gentle on-ramp to infant and early-childhood water safety practices.</li>
              <li>A future directory of free and low-cost swim lessons and programs.</li>
              <li>A developing dashboard to visualize patterns without exposing private details.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="note-box">
            FloatSwim cannot provide medical advice, emergency intervention, or legal guidance. In any suspected drowning or near-drowning emergency,
            call your local emergency number immediately (for example, 911 in the United States).

      <!-- GUIDING PRINCIPLES -->
      <section>
        <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Because this project deals with real families, children, and loss, FloatSwim is anchored by a set of non-negotiable principles that guide how
          information is gathered, shown, and discussed.
        </p>

        <div class="grid-3">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="pill">1. Respect</div>
            <h3>Human dignity first</h3>
            <p>
              Incidents and stories will never be treated as content for shock or clicks. The focus is on learning, honoring, and preventing similar
              tragedies—not reliving trauma.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="pill">2. Prevention</div>
            <h3>Actionable, practical steps</h3>
            <p>
              Wherever possible, FloatSwim emphasizes specific, realistic steps parents, caregivers, and communities can take—not just statistics or
              abstract advice.
            </p>

            <div class="pill">3. Clarity</div>
            <h3>Plain language, calm tone</h3>
            <p>
              The topic is serious enough. The site aims for clear, calm, and compassionate language, avoiding fear-mongering while still telling the
              truth about risk.
            </p>

            <h3>Careful with details</h3>
            <p>
              When incidents are referenced, the emphasis will be on anonymized patterns, age brackets, and settings—not names, addresses, or identifying
              specifics, especially for minors.

              FloatSwim is designed to collaborate with instructors, medical professionals, nonprofits, and community leaders rather than operate in
              isolation.

              stage of development.

        <p class="lead">
          The project is shaped around three main groups: families and caregivers, professionals and organizations, and community advocates who want to
          push for stronger water safety norms.

              have a strong swimming background themselves.

              every day.

              <li><strong>Phase 3 – Deeper tools:</strong> Add alerts, more detailed trends, and organizing tools for community campaigns and advocacy.</li>
