# FloatSwim.org

FloatSwim is an emerging public-impact project focused on drowning prevention, early childhood water safety, and access to free or low-cost swim lessons.

This repository powers the static website at **https://floatswim.org**, hosted via GitHub Pages and managed through this repo.

---

## Mission

- Raise awareness about drowning and near-drowning incidents.
- Emphasize infant and child water safety, starting long before “formal swim lessons.”
- Advocate for accessible swimming education, especially for families with limited resources.
- Build tools (like a dashboard and directory) that help communities see patterns and act sooner.

For more detail, see the live [About page](https://floatswim.org/about.html).

## Current Pages

All pages are static HTML and share a common stylesheet (`style.css`):

- `index.html` – Home / overview of the mission and key sections  
- `about.html` – Mission, principles, and roadmap summary  
- `dashboard.html` – Early prototype of the incident awareness dashboard  
- `resources.html` – Practical water safety guidance and checklists  
- `directory.html` – Placeholder for free / low-cost swim lesson programs  
- `roadmap.html` – Phased plan for how FloatSwim will grow over time  
- `share-story.html` – Future hub for carefully shared stories of survival and lessons learned

## Tech Stack

- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages  
- **Domain:** `floatswim.org` (custom domain pointed at this repo)  
- **Frontend:**  
  - Plain HTML  
  - A single shared `style.css` for layout and design  
  - Minimal JavaScript (currently only for setting the footer year)

No build tools, frameworks, or backend are required at this phase. All edits can be made directly in GitHub’s web UI.
