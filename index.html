      <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS -->

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Drowning is a leading cause of accidental death in young children—and yet it’s silent, fast, and drastically under-discussed. FloatSwim exists
          to change that by making the invisible visible.
        </p>

        <div class="two-col">
          <div>
            <ul class="tight">
              <li>Drowning can happen in seconds, in inches of water, often without a sound.</li>
              <li>Near-drowning events can lead to lifelong medical and emotional impacts.</li>
              <li>Many tragedies are preventable with awareness, layers of protection, and early instruction.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="note-box">
            This site will not share graphic imagery or exploit grief. The goal is to honor stories, surface patterns, and move families and communities
            toward practical, life-saving action.

        <p class="lead">
          Whether you live near the ocean, have a backyard pool, or just bathe your child at home, water safety starts long before “swim lessons.”
