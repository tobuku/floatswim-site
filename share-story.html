            FloatSwim plans to feature survivor and family stories in a way that honors what you have lived through, supports others, and protects your

      <section>
        <h2>How Stories Will Be Treated</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Stories shared with FloatSwim will never be treated as shocking content. The purpose is to offer perspective, comfort, and practical insight
          for others—not to relive trauma or attract clicks.
        </p>

              <li>You will have control over what details are public or private.</li>
              <li>Real names and locations can be changed or omitted if you prefer.</li>
              <li>
                The focus will be on what you learned, what helped, and what you want other families and caregivers to know about water safety.

            Stories involving children are especially sensitive. FloatSwim aims to move slowly and carefully, potentially adding advisory review before
            any story is published.

        <h2>How Sharing Will Work (Future State)</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          As FloatSwim's infrastructure grows, this page may offer a secure submission form with clear consent options and review steps. For now, this
          section outlines the planned process.
        </p>

            <h3>Initial contact</h3>
            <p>
              Families or survivors indicate interest in sharing a story, with no pressure or obligation to publish. You decide how much you want to say
              and when.
            </p>

            <h3>Guided questions</h3>
            <p>
              Simple questions help you decide what to share: what happened, what changed afterward, what you wish others knew, and what helped you most
              in the aftermath.

            <h3>Review & consent</h3>
            <p>
              Before anything is made public, you have a chance to review how your story is presented and confirm that you still consent to sharing it in
              that form.

          Because FloatSwim is in an early build phase, there is no formal submission form yet. If you feel drawn to contribute a story in the future,
          you can reach out by email to start a gentle, no-pressure conversation.

            If you're interested in sharing a story in the future, check back as the submission process develops. There is no obligation or pressure.

          Sharing or reading stories about drowning and near-drowning can bring up intense feelings. FloatSwim is not equipped to provide crisis
          counseling or emergency response.
